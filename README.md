# Animator

Impressionist is an interactive program that creates pictures that look like impressionistic paintings. It is based on a paper and a program by Paul Haeberli. Here is the web "Paint by Numbers".
To create an impressionistic picture, the user loads an existing image and paints a seqence of "brush strokes" onto a blank pixel canvas. These brush strokes pick up color from the original image, giving the look of a painting.

### Required Tasks:

- [ ] Implement the following curve types with support for wrapping:
- [ ] BÃ©zier (splined together with C0 continuity)
- [ ] B-spline
- [ ] Catmull-Rom
- [ ] Implement a particle system that is integrated with your model in some way.
